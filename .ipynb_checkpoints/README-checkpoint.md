# MLS-Project

> This project was tasked with identifying an MLS team to act as a GM to identify a position of the team that needed strengthening. After identifying the position I was tasked with selecting up to 3 trade targets at a cap of $400,000 guaranteed salary. 

The most difficult aspect of this project was the short time constraint, and little access to producable data. I was able to webscrape league standings from the *MLS is Back* tournament which helped to provided a strong base of identifying which MLS team to target. 

My process included:

1. Identifying an MLS Team based on interesting statistics in their league standings
2. Using film analysis and other research to identify a position to strengthen
3. Using American Soccer Analysis to find salary data and passing data to compare defensive players

The notebooks standings contain webscraping data along with intuition behind choosing LAFC. Salaries contains salary information around players to stay below the 400k cap. Data visualizations contain a few visuals indentifying the goals conceded by LAFC. And finally top3picks outlines the process identifying 3 trade targets - Most of this was research done by hand since there was no large amount of data that contained information amoung defenders to compare performance, experience, and assets. 

Some of the technologies I used include numpy, pandas, matplotlib, requests, BeautifulSoup, and more importantly, my domain knowledge of the game.
